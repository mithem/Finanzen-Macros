# Finanzen-Macros

Macros for my Finanzen.ods (LibreOffice) file. Tested on macOS and Windows. Should work on linux as well (possibly with minor modifications).

### Setup

- install python (version 3)
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- install Java Runtime Environment (https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Faq/General/InstallJava)
- APSO LibreOffice extension for managing python macros (https://extensions.libreoffice.org/en/extensions/show/apso-alternative-script-organizer-for-python)
